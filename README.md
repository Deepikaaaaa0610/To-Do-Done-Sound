# Simple To-Do List App

This is a basic, single-file To-Do list application built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It allows users to quickly add, mark as complete, and delete tasks directly in the browser.

## 🚀 How to Use It

1.  **Download:** Get a copy of the `index.html` file.
2.  **Open:** Double-click the file to open it in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3.  **Add a Task:** Type your task in the input field and press `Enter`.
4.  **Complete a Task:** Click on a task to mark it as done (it will be crossed out).
5.  **Delete a Task:** Click the `✖` button next to the task.

## 🎨 Design Theme

The application uses a **High-Contrast Classic** theme for a clear, bold look:

* **Colors:** blue, beige, and Red are used for strong visual separation.
* **Style:** Sharp corners and distinct box shadows give the card a defined, professional appearance.

## 🛠️ Technology Used

* **HTML** (Structure)
* **CSS** (Styling)
* **JavaScript** (Logic)

## 💡 Customization

Since all the code is in one file, it's easy to change:

* You can edit the `<style>` section to change all the colors and fonts.
* You can edit the `<script>` section to change how tasks are handled.
